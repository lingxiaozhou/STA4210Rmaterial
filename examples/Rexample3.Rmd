## Example for ANOVA (toluca)

Data on lot size ($x$) and work hours ($y$) was obtained from 25 recent runs of a manufacturing process.

```{r fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5}
# find relationship between lot size (X) and work hours (Y) 
toluca=read.table("http://www.stat.ufl.edu/~rrandles/sta4210/Rclassnotes/data/textdatasets/KutnerData/Chapter%20%201%20Data%20Sets/CH01TA01.txt",
                  col.names = c("lotsize", "workhrs"))
plot(toluca$lotsize,toluca$workhrs, xlab = "lot size",ylab = "work hours")
toluca.reg=lm(workhrs~lotsize,data=toluca)
abline(toluca.reg)
```

```{r}
anova(toluca.reg)
summary(toluca.reg)
```



**Reduce Model:** $Y_i = \beta_0$  
**Full Model:** $Y_i = \beta_0+\beta_1x_i$

```{r}
Red <- lm(workhrs~1,data=toluca)
Full <- toluca.reg

anova(Red,Full)
```


# Diagnostic on Predictor

**Goal**: Identify any outlying values in predictor, $x$ that could affect the appropriateness of the linear model.

**Two main issues**

* Outliers (Histogram and/or Boxplot)
* Levels of predictor associated with the run order when experiment is run sequentially (Sequence/ Time Series Plot)

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(toluca$lotsize,xlab = "lot size",main = "Histogram")
boxplot(toluca$lotsize)
```

* Do not appear to be any outliers


```{r fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5}
plot(toluca$lotsize,type = "b",xlab = "Run order", ylab = "Lot size", main = "Sequence Plot")
```

* No discernible pattern/depenency of the values and run order.





# Checking Model Assumptions Graphically

Inference are only valid if the model assumptions are valid.
$$Y_i = \beta_0+\beta_1x_i+\epsilon_i,\hspace{1cm}i=1,\dots,n,$$ where $\epsilon_i\stackrel{iid}{\sim}N(0,\sigma)$ for $i = 1,\dots,n.$

* Normality: The errors are normally distributed
* Independence: The errors are independent of each other.
* Homogeneity of Variance: The variance of the residuals is the same for all values of X.
* Linearity: The relationship between the independent variable ($x$) and the mean of the dependent variable ($Y$) is linear.


# Residuals

* Assumptions can be checked with residuals $e_i: = y_i-\hat y_i$, or better yet, the standardized/studentized residuals
* Standardized residuals have mean 0 and standard deviation of 1
* Studentized residuals are standardized residuals that use the leave-one-out approach. The $i-$th observation is omitted when fitting thr model is then used to predict (without bias) the response for the $i-$th observation. More on this later
* In R, use `rstandard()` and `rstudent()` function to obtain the standardized and studentized residual.

# Normality

## Empirical CDF

**Def**: CDF associated with the smpirical measuare of the sample. Assigns equal probability $1/n$ to each point and is a step function
$$\hat F_n(x) = \frac{\mathrm{number\  of\  elements}\le x}{n} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n I\{x_i\le x\}$$
where $I(\cdot)$ is the indicator function.

**Example:** consider the sample $1,3,7,8$
$$
\hat F_4(x) = 
\begin{cases}
0 &\mathrm{if\  } x<1\\
0.25 &\mathrm{if\  } 1\le x<3\\
0.5 &\mathrm{if\  } 3\le x<7\\
0.75 &\mathrm{if\  } 7\le x<8\\
1 &\mathrm{if\  } x\ge 8
\end{cases}
$$
```{r fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5}
sample_data <- c(1,3,7,8)
edf <- ecdf(sample_data)

# Plot the empirical distribution function
plot(edf, main = "Empirical CDF",
     xlab = "x", ylab = "F(x)",
     verticals = FALSE, do.points = FALSE)
```

* The more data points the smaller the jumps and the step function begins to look like an "S" curve

**Example:** Generate 100 observations from a N(5,2) and plot the empirical CDF and overlay the theoretical CDF from N(5,2)

```{r fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5}
set.seed(111)
y <- rnorm(100,5,2)
edf <- ecdf(y)
plot(edf,main = "Empirical CDF")
curve(pnorm(x,5,3),add = TRUE,col = "red")
legend("topleft",legend = c("ECDF","N(5,2) CDF"),lty = 1, col = c("black","red"))
```

## Q-Q plot

Let $G(\cdot)$ denotes the theoretical normal CDF  
Q-Q plot plots the quantile function $\hat F_n^{-1}(x)$ versus $G^{-1}(x)$

```{r fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5}
qqnorm(toluca.reg$residuals)
qqline(toluca.reg$residuals)
```

## Independence

* Time series plot of residual vs time order in which it was recorded
* Sorted data may invalidate conclusion
* Independence is graphically check if there is no discernible pattern

```{r fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5}
plot(rstandard(toluca.reg), type = "b", xlab = "Order",ylab = "Standardized residual",main = "Independence")
abline(h=0)
```

## Homogeneity of variance

* Plot of the standardized/studentized residuals versus the fitted values
    - Constant variance: constant spread/distance of the residuals

```{r fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5}
plot(toluca.reg$fitted.values,rstandard(toluca.reg),xlab  ="fitted values", ylab = "standardized residuals")
```

## Linearity

* Scatter plot: For good model fit, scatterplot indicate a linear trend.
* Residual vs fitted: For good model fit, residuals should evenly spread on either side of the 0 line.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
x <- rnorm(30,0,3)
eps <- rnorm(30,0,2)
y <- x^2+eps
plot(x,y)
fit <- lm(y~x)
abline(fit,col="red")
plot(fit$fitted.values, rstandard(fit),xlab  ="fitted values", ylab = "standardized residuals")
abline(h=0)
```

* We may still fit a linear model by adding or transforming predictors to include higer polynomial terms. For example, $Y_i = \beta_0+\beta_1x^2+\epsilon_i$
